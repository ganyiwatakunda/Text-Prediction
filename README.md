# Text-Prediction

This program implements a statistical trigram language model with the NLTK library to predict the next word based on the Alice in Wonderland corpus.

## Getting started
1. clone or download this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jadessechan/Text-Prediction.git
```
2. run main.py
3. once prompted by the program, enter a phrase related to the corpus

## Demo
Lines 80-86 display n-gram statistics of the corpus and are commented-out by default.
Here is a frequency distribution plot of the most common 30 trigrams:
